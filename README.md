	4. Storage: LocalStorage (for demonstration purposes)



# Components Overview
The project is modular, with each feature implemented as a reusable component. Below is an overview of the core components:
	1. Dashboard
		Purpose: Provides an overview of the application, showing statistics and recent activities.
		Key Features:
		Displays the total count of users, roles, and permissions.
		Lists recent changes or updates in the application.
		Provides quick navigation links to core sections like Users, Roles, and Permissions.
		File: Dashboard.js
		Style: Dashboard.css
	2. Users Management
		Purpose: Enables management of users with features to add, edit, delete, and assign roles.
		Key Features:
			Add new users by providing details such as name, email, and role.
			Edit existing users to update their information or change their assigned roles.
			Delete users who are no longer active in the system.
		File: Users.js
		Style: Users.css
	3. Roles Management
		Purpose: Allows creation, editing, and deletion of roles within the system.
		Key Features:
			Add roles dynamically with unique names.
			Edit existing roles to update their names.
			Delete roles that are obsolete or no longer in use.
		File: Roles.js
		Style: Roles.css
	4. Permission Management
		Purpose: Provides tools to manage permissions assigned to each role dynamically.
		Key Features:
			View and modify permissions associated with each role.
			Available permissions include view, edit, delete, publish, and archive.
			Automatically updates the roles and permissions across the app when changes are made.
		File: PermissionManagement.js
		Style: PermissionManagement.css
	5. Context API for State Management
		Purpose: Manages global application state to ensure consistent and real-time updates across components.
		Key Features:
			Centralized storage for users, roles, and permissions.
			Automatically propagates state changes to all dependent components.
		File: AppContext.js
	6. Shared UI Elements
		Purpose: Provides reusable UI components to ensure consistency across the application.
		Examples:
			Buttons: Add, Edit, Delete, Save Changes.
			Input Fields: Text inputs for creating or editing users and roles.
			Lists: Displaying users, roles, or permissions dynamically.
	



# Future Enhancements
	> Backend Integration:
		1. Connect to an API for persistent data storage and retrieval.
		2. Use a database to replace LocalStorage.
	> Authentication:	
		1. Add user login and role-based access control.
	> Enhanced UI/UX:
		1. Add pagination for user and role management.
		2. Use a UI library like Material-UI for better design consistency.
	> Testing:
		1. Add unit tests for each component.
		2. Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library.



## Prerequisites

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
