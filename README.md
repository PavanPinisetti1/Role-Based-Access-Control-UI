	5. Context API for State Management
		Purpose: Manages global application state to ensure consistent and real-time updates across components.
		Key Features:
			- Centralized storage for users, roles, and permissions.
			- Automatically propagates state changes to all dependent components.
		File: AppContext.js
  
	6. Shared UI Elements
		Purpose: Provides reusable UI components to ensure consistency across the application.
		Examples:
			- Buttons: Add, Edit, Delete, Save Changes.
			- Input Fields: Text inputs for creating or editing users and roles.

# Future Enhancements
	> Backend Integration:
		1. Connect to an API for persistent data storage and retrieval.
		2. Use a database to replace LocalStorage.
	> Authentication:	
		1. Add user login and role-based access control.
	> Enhanced UI/UX:
		1. Add pagination for user and role management.
		2. Use a UI library like Material-UI for better design consistency.
	> Testing:
		1. Add unit tests for each component.
		2. Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
